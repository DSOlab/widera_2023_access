# Topic A: The (usual) Twining Bottom-Up

To prevent further disparities, maximise investment in Research and Development and
enhance economic growth, Horizon Europe is taking relevant actions under Widening
participation and spreading excellence objective. Twinning actions are one of the main
instruments of this objective.

Twinning aims to enhance networking activities between the research institutions of the
Widening countries acting as co-ordinators and top-class leading counterparts at European
Union level by linking it with at least two research institutions from two different Member
States or Associated Countries. Therefore, building on the huge potential of networking for
excellence through knowledge transfer and exchange of best practice between research
institutions and partners. Twinning actions intend to help raise the research profile of the
institution from the Widening country as well as the research profile of its staff including a
special focus on strengthening the research management and administrative skills of the
coordination institution from the Widening country.

Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:

* Improved excellence capacity and resources in Widening countries enabling to close the
still apparent research and innovation gap within the European Union;

* Enhanced strategic networking activities between the research institutions of the
Widening countries and at least two internationally-leading counterparts at European
Union level;

* Raised reputation, research profile and attractiveness of the coordinating institution from
the Widening country and the research profile of its staff;

Strengthened research management capacities and administrative skills of the staff
working in institutions from the Widening country;

* Improved creativity supported by development of new approaches in Research and
Innovation collaboration, increased mobility (inwards and outwards) of qualified
scientists.

**Scope** Twinning proposals should have to clearly outline the scientific strategy for stepping
up and stimulating scientific excellence and innovation capacity in a defined area of research
and innovation as well as the scientific quality of the partners involved in the twinning
exercise. This scientific strategy should include arrangements for formulating new (or
ongoing) joint research / innovation project(s) in the scientific area of choice and describe
how Twinning will take this research to a new stage, by enlarging its scope and/or the
research / innovation partnerships.

Such a strategy should include a comprehensive set of activities to be supported. These should
include at least a number of the following: short-term staff exchanges; expert visits and short
term on-site or virtual training; workshops; conference attendance; organisation of joint
summer school type activities; dissemination and outreach activities. As far as appropriate
these activities should take into account the gender equality plans of the participants.

Proposals should also focus on strengthening the research management and administration
skills of the coordinating institution from the Widening country. This should take the form of
a dedicated work package or task, placing emphasis to specific activities, in view of helping
the staff of the coordinating institution to improve their proposal preparation and project
management/administration skills. If not yet in place, setting up/upgrading a research
management/administration unit within the coordinating institution would be beneficial. This
will be achieved by fully utilising the experience and best practices of the internationally
leading partners and is expected to be a concrete deliverable of the Twinning exercise.

A research / innovation component not exceeding 30% of the total Horizon Europe grant may
include a research / innovation project. At least 50% of the budget for the research /
innovation component must be allocated to the coordinator. This will open opportunities for
integrating smaller research / innovation activities and by this strengthening the commitment
and the engagement of the twinning partners. The research part of the project should be
presented through a dedicated work package and plan including the scientific objectives, tasks
and roles of the partners.

The Twinning proposals should illustrate quantitatively and qualitatively the expected
potential impact of the twinning exercise within the coordinating institution (and possibly at
regional/national level) based on indicators such as expected future publications in peer
reviewed journals, collaboration agreements with businesses, intellectual property, new
innovative products or services, number of international students, number of women scientists
and their roles in the research institutions.

It should be explained how the leading scientific institutions in the partnership will contribute
in terms of provision of access to new research avenues, creativity and the development of
new approaches, as well as acting as a source for increased mobility (inwards and outwards)
of qualified scientists and young researchers including doctoral candidates. The benefits for
the leading scientific institutions and the way they would materialise through the partnership
should be substantiated.

Specific attention should be paid to gender equality objectives, in line with the organisationsâ€™
commitments through their adopted gender equality plans, and in line with European
Research Area (ERA) objectives, as far as appropriate. The presence of a gender equality plan
is an eligibility criterion.

The duration of the Twinning project should be up to 3 years.
