Since the introduction of Earth orbiting satellites, Satellite Geodesy has played 
a crucial role in our understanding of the complex Earth system. An ever increasing 
number of space-based applications, including but not limited to climate change, 
positioning, space exploration, security and awarness, Earth kinematics and reference
frames maintenance, geodynamics, etc, are heavily dependent on results and products 
derived by methods of Satellite Geodesy, and hence correlated with advances and 
progress within this scientific field. Observing the Earth system through space, is 
in essence an excercise of Satellite Geodesy.

The Project Coordinator (NTUA), via its School of Rural, Surveying and Geoinformatics 
Engineering, is the oldest and most prestigious institution in Greece providing 
a curriculum in the field of Geodesy. It has a twofold role in Greece; on the one 
hand educating and training the next generation of geodesy experts and on the 
other hand, being involved in relevant research both to support its academic expertise 
and also to push scientific frontiers.

ACRONYM aims at creating of a center of excellence for Satellite Geodesy, hosted 
by the Project Coordinator (NTUA), with the crucial contribution of leading experts 
in the field. Within this framework, NTUA will enhance its academic and scientific 
footprint, increase its technology and research capacity and promote innovation 
and the involvement of Greece (both public and private sector) in Space.

Through the synergy with internationally-leading collaborating institutes, NTUA 
will be able to:

    * modernize and enhance its academic curriculum bot at pre-graduate and graduate 
      level, via the knowledge and expertise gained by leading experts; organize 
      summer schools, focussing on PhD students and post-docs 
    * further educate its research and teaching personnel in recent advancements, 
      methods and techniques, as well as modern instrumentation; this process 
      will include one-to-one mentoring and one-to-many and on-site training, 
      bidirectional visits including instrumentation sites and the establishement 
      of a solid, one-way knowledge and expertise flow channel
    * spread knowledge and expertise and promote innovation via a series of 
      PhD and post-doc programs to be carried out in close collaboration with 
      the partners (3 PhD and 1 post-doc)
    * enhance the hosts's capacity in partnership-building, preperation and 
      carrying out of research proposals funded by national authorities, the 
      European Commission (EC) and the European Space Agency (ESA),
    * establish a network of collaborations and getting involved in high calibre 
      international consortia (e.g. IDS, ILRS, GGOS) securing its long term 
      inclusion in the future steps of Space Geodesy.
