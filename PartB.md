## 1.1 Objectives 

> Briefly describe the objectives of your proposed work. Why are they pertinent 
> to the work programme topic? Are they measurable and verifiable? Are they 
> realistically achievable?

Since the introduction of Earth orbiting satellites, Space Geodesy has played 
a crucial role in our understanding of the complex Earth system. An ever increasing 
number of space-based applications, including but not limited to climate change, 
positioning, space exploration, security and awarness, Earth kinematics and reference
frames maintenance, geodynamics, etc, are heavily dependent on results and products 
derived by methods of Space Geodesy, and hence correlated with advances and 
progress within this scientific field. Observing the Earth system through space, is 
in essence an excercise of Satellite Geodesy.

The Project Coordinator (NTUA), via its School of Rural, Surveying and Geoinformatics 
Engineering, is the oldest and most prestigious institution in Greece providing 
a curriculum in the field of Geodesy. It has a twofold role in Greece; on the one 
hand educating and training the next generation of geodesy experts and on the 
other hand, being involved in relevant research both to support its academic expertise 
and also to push scientific frontiers.

ACRONYM aims at creating of a center of excellence for Space Geodesy, hosted 
by the Project Coordinator (NTUA), with the crucial contribution of leading experts 
in the field. Within this framework, NTUA will enhance its academic and scientific 
footprint, increase its technology and research capacity and promote innovation 
and the involvement of Greece (both public and private sector) in Space.

Through the synergy with internationally-leading collaborating institutes, NTUA 
will be able to:

* modernize and enhance its academic curriculum bot at pre-graduate and graduate 
  level, via the knowledge and expertise gained by leading experts; organize 
  summer schools, focussing on PhD students and post-docs 

* further educate its research and teaching personnel in recent advancements, 
  methods and techniques, as well as modern instrumentation; this process 
  will include one-to-one mentoring and one-to-many and on-site training, 
  bidirectional visits including instrumentation sites and the establishement 
  of a solid, one-way knowledge and expertise flow channel

* spread knowledge and expertise and promote innovation via a series of 
  PhD and post-doc programs to be carried out in close collaboration with 
  the partners (3 PhD and 1 post-doc)

* enhance the hosts's capacity in partnership-building, preperation and 
  carrying out of research proposals funded by national authorities, the 
  European Commission (EC) and the European Space Agency (ESA),

* establish a network of collaborations and getting involved in high calibre 
  international consortia (e.g. IDS, ILRS, GGOS) securing its long term 
  inclusion in the future steps of Space Geodesy.

### 1.2.1 Proposed Methodology

Modern Space Geodesy input is based on four fundamental observational pillars, 
namelly GNSS, DORIS, SLR and VLBI. These four techniques provide the crucial dataset 
to study the Earth system and in turn provide the prerequisite products for 
a wide range of space-based applications and study fields.

While NTUA has a well established expertise in the field of GNSS, verifiable by 
its constribution in international consortia (e.g. EUREF) and its long list of 
relevant publications in scientific journals, its lacks knowledge, involvement and 
expertise in the other three techniques that lay at the core of Space Geodesy.
This severely weakens both its academic and research capabilities at the field, as 
well as its ability to drive innovation for the country in a fast growing market, 
related to Space.

Within the framework of ACRONYM, synergies are proposed with leading experts in the 
techniques of DORIS, SLR and VLBI with the aim of closing the knowledge and technological 
gap and thus significantly strenghtening NTUA's academic and research capacity 
and potential. Each member of the consortium will act as a knowledge transfer node 
for one of the techniques involved

IGN and CLS will act as the DORIS expertise node. Both institutes are leading 
experts in the field, heavily involved in the technique since its introduction. 
Their role and contribution is underpinned by their status as Analysis Centers, 
and involvement in the IDS. The two institutes will take up the task of transfering 
relevant knowledge to NTUA via:
* personnel visits from the institutes to NTUA and vice-versa,
* co-supervision of one PhD and one post-doc dissertation,
* provide assistance in expanding and refining NTUA's DORIS data analysis toolbox,
* organization of a joint summer school,
* establishment of sound long-term collaboration aiming at future synergies

NTUA has, in recent years, started an effort to take up the technique, build 
a software package to process DORIS data and get involved in the international 
consortium of IDS. The assistance of IGN and CLS will prove to be invaluable for 
the stepping up of this effort, and the consolidation of NTUA's contribution in 
the technique. Additionally, the two institutes are long contributors of the 
IDS and can introduce NTUA in the service, a fact that can lead to a solid, 
long lasting technical involvement and further networking capacity with high esteem 
institutions.

GFZ will act as the SLR node, since it has a longstanding contribution in the 
technique, evident by its involvement in the ILRS as an Analysis Center. Dissemination 
of knowledge and expertise will be carried out via:
* personnel visits from the institutes to NTUA and vice-versa,
* co-supervision of one PhD,
* provide assistance in building an SLR data analysis toolbox,
* organization of a joint summer school,
* on-site visit of NTUA personnel at the SLR station at Potsdam, operated by GFZ,
* establishment of sound long-term collaboration aiming at future synergies

Despite SLR's prominent role in Space Geodesy, NTUA's involvement in the technique 
has been minimum in the last few decades. Besides core geodetic results (e.g. 
Earth Orientation Parameters) SLR provides the most accurate observations for 
Precise Orbit Determination, a problem inherently coupled with all space geodetic 
applications.


OSO/Chalmers will act as the VLBI knowledge node. OSO hosts one of the few VLBI 
sites in Europe and is a prominent member of the International VLBI Service for 
Geodesy and Astrometry. OSO will undertake the task of transfering technique-specific 
knowledge to NTUA, via:
* personnel visits from the institutes to NTUA and vice-versa,
* co-supervision of one PhD,
* organization of a joint summer school,
* on-site visit of NTUA personnel at the observation site operated by OSO 

By means of a specialized, tehcnique-based contribution of each member of the 
consortium to the host (NTUA), knowledge transfer can be better achieved, managed,
digested and verified. The host institution will be the sole recipient of this 
one-way flow of expertise, attributing dedicated personnel to each of the techniques 
described, thus creating a pool of experts.

This highly-skilled work force will in turn disperse the knowledge gained, via 
NTUA's academic capacity, to the future Space- and Geo-scientists of Greece, 
significantly boosting innnovation and the country's involvement in the growing 
satellite-based application market.
